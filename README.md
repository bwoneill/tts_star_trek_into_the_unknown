# Tabletop Simulator Star Trek Into the Unknown

Based on Star Trek Into the Unknown by Wizkids Games.

As always I seek no monetization for this work as this is intended to connect players who don't readily have access to spaces to play. As always support the developers of the official releases -CrazyVulcan

PS Still working on assets so expect a number of changes rapidly over the next weeks. Consider this a living table utill we know what is needed.
